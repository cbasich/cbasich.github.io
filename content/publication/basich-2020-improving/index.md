abstract: 'Given the complexity of real-world, unstructured domains, it is often impossible or impractical to
design models that include every feature needed to handle all possible scenarios that an autonomous
system may encounter. For an autonomous system to be reliable in such domains, it should have
the ability to improve its competence online. In this paper, we propose a method for improving the
competence of a system over the course of its deployment. We specifically focus on a class of semi-
autonomous systems known as competence-aware systems that model their own competence—the
optimal extent of autonomy to use in any given situation—and learn this competence over time from
feedback received through interactions with a human authority. Our method exploits such feedback
to identify important state features missing from the system’s initial model, and incorporates them
into its state representation. The result is an agent that better predicts human involvement, leading to
improvements in its competence and reliability, and as a result, its overall performance.'
