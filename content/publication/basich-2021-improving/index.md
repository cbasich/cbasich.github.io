abstract: 'Abstract— Despite considerable efforts by human designers,
accounting for every unique situation that an autonomous
robotic system deployed in the real world could face is often
an infeasible task. As a result, many such deployed systems
still rely on human assistance in various capacities to complete
certain tasks while staying safe. Competence-aware systems
(CAS) is a recently proposed model for reducing such reliance
on human assistance while in turn optimizing the system’s
global autonomous operation by learning its own competence.
However, such systems are limited by a fixed model of their
environment and may perform poorly if their a priori plan-
ning model does not include certain features that emerge as
important over the course of the system’s deployment. In this
paper, we propose a method for improving the competence of a
CAS over time by identifying important state features missing
from the system’s model and incorporating them into its state
representation, thereby refining its state space. Our approach
exploits information that exists in the standard CAS model and
adds no extra work to the human. The result is an agent that
better predicts human involvement, improving its competence,
reliability, and overall performance.'
