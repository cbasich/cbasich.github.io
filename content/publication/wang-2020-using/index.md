abstract: 'When planning in unknown environments, a planner
must ensure robustness to unknown phenomena and
manage unpredictable variation in execution. Productivity in the face of these challenges requires an integrated approach to planning and execution that is capable of reacting to variation while still maximizing
overall utility. We examine this problem in the context
of the Europa Lander mission concept. We propose a
planning and execution framework that responds to
feedback using three techniques: (1) flexible execution, (2) periodic replanning, and (3) online model parameter and utility updates. The efficacy of each of
these techniques is examined through simulation of the
Europa Lander concept, showing higher utility
achievement compared to baseline approaches.'
