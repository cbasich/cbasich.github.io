abstract: 'Dynamic ridesharing services (DRS) play a major
role in improving the efficiency of urban transportation. User
satisfaction in dynamic ridesharing is determined by multiple
factors such as travel time, cost, and social compatibility with
co-passengers. Existing DRS optimize profit by maximizing
the operational value for service providers or minimizing the
travel time for users but they neglect the social experience
of riders, which significantly influences the total value of the
service to users. We propose DROPS, a dynamic ridesharing
framework that factors the riders’ social preferences in the
matching process so as to improve the quality of the trips
formed. The trip formation is a multi-objective optimization
that aims to maximize the operational value for the service
provider, while simultaneously maximizing the value of the trip
for the users. The user value is estimated based on compatibility
between co-passengers and the ride time. We also present a
real-time matching algorithm for trip formation. Finally, we
evaluate our approach empirically using real-world taxi trips
data, and a population model including social preferences based
on user surveys. Our approach improves the user value and
users’ social compatibility, without significantly affecting the
vehicle miles for the service provider and travel time for users.
