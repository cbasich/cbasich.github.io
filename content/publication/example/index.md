abstract: Contemporary planning models and methods often rely on constant
  availability of free state information at each step of execution. However,
  autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in the open world where state
  information may be costly or simply unavailable in certain situations. Failing
  to account for sensor limitations may lead to costly behavior or even
  catastrophic failure. While the \emph{partially observable Markov decision
  process} (POMDP) can be used to model this problem, solving POMDPs is often
  intractable. We propose a novel planning model called a \emph{semi-observable
  Markov decision process} (SOMDP) specifically designed for Markov decision
  processes where state observability may be intermittent.  We propose an
  approach for solving SOMDPs that uses \emph{memory states} to proactively plan
  for the potential loss of sensor information while exploiting the unique
  structure of SOMDPs. We provide several theoretical results for this model and
  demonstrate empirically the efficiency of our approach relative to planning
  with existing models.
