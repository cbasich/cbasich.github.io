abstract: 'As mobile robots are deployed in increasingly com-
plex domains in the open world, the level of detail
demanded by the robot’s decision-making model
to ensure reliable operation increases. To support
this, mobile robotic agents are fixed with a wider
array of more informative sensor equipment and
downstream perception systems that convert such
sensors’ information into usable representations by
the agent’s planning models. Automated decision
making models often assume free and consistent
access to such information. However, in the con-
text of a mobile robot, this assumption may not
hold, and failing to account for this in the plan-
ning model may lead to costly behavior or even
failure. In this paper, we propose a mixed open-
loop/closed-loop planning model based on memory
states that integrates knowledge about limitations
on sensory feedback in order to proactively plan
around these limitations or exploit situations where
costly sensing is unnecessary. We provide both the-
oretical properties as well as empirical evaluations
on a simulated mobile robot domain.'
