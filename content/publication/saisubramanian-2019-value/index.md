abstract: 'Dynamic ridesharing services (DRS) play a major role in improving the efficiency of urban transportation. User satisfaction in dynamic ridesharing is determined by multiple factors such as travel time, cost, and social compatibility with
co-passengers. Existing DRS optimize profit by maximizing
the operational value for service providers or minimize travel
time for users but they neglect the social experience of riders,
which significantly influences the total value of the service to
users. We propose DROPS, a dynamic ridesharing framework
that factors the riders’ social preferences in the matching process so as to improve the quality of the trips formed. Scheduling trips for users is a multi-objective optimization that aims
to maximize the operational value for the service provider,
while simultaneously maximizing the value of the trip for the
users. The user value is estimated based on compatibility between co-passengers and the ride time. We then present a realtime matching algorithm for trip formation. Finally, we evaluate our approach empirically using real-world taxi trips data,
and a population model including social preferences based on
user surveys. The results demonstrate improvement in riders’
social compatibility, without significantly affecting the vehicle miles for the service provider and travel time for users.'
