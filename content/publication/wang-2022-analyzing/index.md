abstract: 'Plan execution in unknown environments poses a number of
challenges: uncertainty in domain modeling, stochasticity at
execution time, and the presence of exogenous events. These
challenges motivate an integrated approach to planning and
execution that is able to respond intelligently to variation.
We examine this problem in the context of the Europa Lander mission concept, and evaluate a planning and execution
framework that responds to feedback and task failure using
two techniques: flexible execution and replanning with plan
optimization. We develop a theoretical framework to estimate
gains from these techniques, and we compare these predictions to empirical results generated in simulation. These results indicate that an integrated approach to planning and execution leveraging flexible execution, replanning, and utility
maximization shows significant promise for future tightlyconstrained space missions that must address significant uncertainty.'
