abstract: 'While developers carefully specify the high-level
decision-making models in autonomous systems,
it is infeasible for these models to ensure safety
across every scenario that can be encountered during operation. We therefore propose a safety metareasoning system that mitigates the severity of the
system’s safety concerns while reducing the interference to the system’s task: the system executes
in parallel a task process that completes the task
and safety processes that each address a safety concern, arbitrating with a conflict resolver. This paper
offers a definition of a safety metareasoning system, an evaluation rating generation algorithm for
a safety process, a conflict resolution algorithm for
a conflict resolver, an application of our approach
to planetary rover exploration, and a demonstration
that our approach is effective in simulation.'
