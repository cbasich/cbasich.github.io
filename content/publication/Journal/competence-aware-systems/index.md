abstract: "Building autonomous systems for deployment in the open world has been a longstanding objective in both artificial intelligence and robotics. The open world, however, presents novel challenges that question some of the assumptions often made in contemporary AI models. Autonomous systems that operate in the open world face complex, non-stationary environments wherein enumerating all situations the system may face over the course of its deployment is intractable. Nevertheless, these systems are expected to operate safely and reliably for extended durations. Consequently, many of these systems exhibit some degree of reliance on human assistance to mitigate risks while completing their tasks, and are hence better treated as *semi-autonomous systems*. In order to reduce unnecessary reliance on humans and optimize autonomy, we propose a novel introspective planning model---*competence-aware systems* (CAS)---that enables a semi-autonomous system to reason about its own competence in the form of multiple levels of autonomy by leveraging human feedback or assistance. A CAS learns to adjust its level of autonomy based on experience and interactions with a human authority to reduce improper reliance on the human, consequently optimizing the degree of autonomy it employs in any given circumstance.  To handle situations where the initial CAS model has an insufficient state representation to properly discriminate feedback received from humans, we then introduce a methodology called *iterative state space refinement* for iteratively increasing the granularity of the state space online. The approach exploits information that exists in the standard CAS model and requires no additional input from the human. The result is an agent that can more confidently predict the correct feedback from the human authority in each level of autonomy, enabling it learn its competence in a larger portion of the state space."
