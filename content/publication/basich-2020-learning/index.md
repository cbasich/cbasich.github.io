abstract: 'Interest in semi-autonomous systems (SAS) is growing rapidly as a
paradigm to deploy autonomous systems in domains that require
occasional reliance on humans. This paradigm allows service robots
or autonomous vehicles to operate at varying levels of autonomy
and offer safety in situations that require human judgment. We
propose an introspective model of autonomy that is learned and
updated online through experience and dictates the extent to which
the agent can act autonomously in any given situation. We define
a competence-aware system (CAS) that explicitly models its own
proficiency at different levels of autonomy and the available human
feedback. A CAS learns to adjust its level of autonomy based on
experience to maximize overall efficiency, factoring in the cost of
human assistance. We analyze the convergence properties of CAS
and provide experimental results for robot delivery and autonomous
driving domains that demonstrate the benefits of the approach.'
