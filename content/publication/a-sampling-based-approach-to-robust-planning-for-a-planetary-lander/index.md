abstract: Planning for autonomous operation in unknown environments poses a
  number of technical challenges. The agent must ensure robustness to unknown
  phenomena, unpredictable variation in execution, and uncertain resources, all
  while maximizing its objective. These challenges are exacerbated in the
  context of space missions where uncertainty is often higher, long
  communication delays necessitate robust autonomous execution, and severely
  constrained computational resources limit the scope of planning techniques
  that can be used. We examine this problem in the context of a Europa Lander
  concept mission where an autonomous lander must collect valuable data and
  communicate that data back to Earth. We model the problem as a hierarchical
  task network, framing it as a utility maximization problem constrained by a
  strictly monotonically decreasing energy resource. We propose a novel
  deterministic planning framework that uses periodic replanning and
  sampling-based optimization to better handle model uncertainty and execution
  variation, while remaining computationally tractable. We demonstrate the
  efficacy of our framework through simulations of a Europa Lander concept
  mission in which our approach outperforms several baselines in utility
  maximization and robustness.
