abstract: 'Although experts carefully specify the high-level
decision-making models in autonomous systems, it is infeasible
to guarantee safety across every scenario during operation. We
therefore propose a safety metareasoning system that optimizes
the severity of the system’s safety concerns and the interference
to the system’s task: the system executes in parallel a task
process that completes a specified task and safety processes that
each address a specified safety concern with a conflict resolver
for arbitration. This paper offers a formal definition of a safety
metareasoning system, a recommendation algorithm for a safety
process, an arbitration algorithm for a conflict resolver, an
application of our approach to planetary rover exploration, and
a demonstration that our approach is effective in simulation.'
