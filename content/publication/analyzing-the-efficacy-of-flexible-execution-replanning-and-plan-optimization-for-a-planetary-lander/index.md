abstract: "Plan execution in unknown environments poses a number of challenges:
  uncertainty in domain modeling, stochasticity at execution time, and the
  presence of exogenous events. These challenges motivate an integrated approach
  to planning and execution that is able to respond intelligently to variation.
  We examine this problem in the context of the Europa Lander mission concept,
  and evaluate a planning and execution framework that responds to feedback and
  task failure using two techniques: flexible execution and replanning with plan
  optimization. We develop a theoretical framework to estimate gains from these
  techniques, and we compare these predictions to empirical results generated in
  simulation. These results indicate  that an integrated approach to planning
  and execution leveraging flexible execution, replanning, and utility
  maximization shows significant promise for future tightly-constrained space
  missions that must address significant uncertainty."
