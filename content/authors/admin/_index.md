I am currently a 6th year PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the Resource-Bounded Reasoning Lab advised by Dr. Shlomo Zilberstein. My general research interests include, but are not limited to, probabilistic planning, decision making under uncertainty, safe and robust artificial intelligence, and reinforcement learning.
